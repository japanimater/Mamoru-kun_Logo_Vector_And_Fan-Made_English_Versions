# Mamoru-kun_Logo_Vector_And_Fan-Made_English_Versions 
The image files contained within this repository are vector images I made of all logos from Mamoru-kun(from CyberConnect2). 

Following the devastation of the 2011/03/11 earthquake in Japan, CyberConnect2's character Mamoru-kun was nominated as a mascot character to represent the donation charity event project for the victims. 
Mamoru-kun is also used to teach how to prepare and respond to disasters, both natural and man-made. 
Mamoru-kun is part of the larger Little Tail Bronx world/lore. 
I have also created English versions of the logos that have none. 
The "Reconstruction Assistance Project" logo already had an English version, so I used parts of that for the others. 
For this project, I also provided an Adobe Illustrator file that shows my creative process behind the building of the vectors.
